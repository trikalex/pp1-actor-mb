                    "Marius Bodochi is one of the few, rare actors who have the strength to express such a character
                    with such elegance (Antonio Salieri from "Amadeus" by Peter Shaffer, directed by Marcel Top). I
                    would say about Marius Bodochi that he is an artist, a creator of the image from all its angles,
                    psychologically, up to physical identification, through the power of expression, through the subtle
                    nuances that only a great artist perceives in a character of Salieri's stature."
